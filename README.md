# Directory server setup

The app relies on a DS with the evaluation profile and an HTTPS connection handler listening at `https://localhost:8443`.
In the default password policy, turn off the requirement to authenticate over a secure connection.

For example:

```sh
unzip -q ~/.m2/repository/org/forgerock/opendj/opendj-server/7.5.0-SNAPSHOT/opendj-server-7.5.0-SNAPSHOT.zip

export DEPLOYMENT_ID=ADaMkVIXfryp4tZN3_0V4WoB3BZc9SQ5CBVN1bkVDE6OSY5Kl7pIibg

./opendj/setup \                                                                                    
 --serverId evaluation-only \
 --deploymentId $DEPLOYMENT_ID \
 --deploymentIdPassword password \
 --rootUserDN uid=admin \
 --rootUserPassword password \
 --monitorUserPassword password \
 --hostname localhost \
 --adminConnectorPort 4444 \
 --ldapPort 1389 \
 --enableStartTls \
 --ldapsPort 1636 \     
 --httpsPort 8443 \                          
 --replicationPort 8989 \
 --bootstrapReplicationServer localhost:8989 \
 --profile ds-evaluation \
 --start \
 --acceptLicense

To see basic server status and configuration, you can launch
/path/to/opendj/bin/status
```

In the DS evaluation profile:

* Babs Jensen's mail is `bjensen@example.com` and password is `hifalutin`.
* Kirsten Vaughan (admin) has mail `kvaughan@example.com` and password `bribery`.
* Generated users are like `user.0@example.com` and their passwords are all `password`.

## 💡 Usage

This section covers how to start the development server and build your project for production.

### Starting the Development Server

To start the development server with hot-reload, run the following command. The server will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```bash
yarn dev
```

(Repeat for npm, pnpm, and bun with respective commands.)

> Add NODE_OPTIONS='--no-warnings' to suppress the JSON import warnings that happen as part of the Vuetify import mapping. If you are on Node [v21.3.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v21.3.0) or higher, you can change this to NODE_OPTIONS='--disable-warning=5401'. If you don't mind the warning, you can remove this from your package.json dev script.

### Building for Production

To build your project for production, use:

```bash
yarn build
```

(Repeat for npm, pnpm, and bun with respective commands.)

Once the build process is completed, your application will be ready for deployment in a production environment.
